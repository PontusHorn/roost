AXEHANDEL
A Font by S. John Ross
Cumberland Games & Diversions

AxeHandel is a warm-asphalt sort of font, a hug-the-ground sort of font. It's a stress-font in a variation of the Cumberland house style, with lessons applied from many previous efforts. I think it speaks of strength, but a shabby, weatherbeaten kind of strength.
